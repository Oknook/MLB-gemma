# Gemma Sprint Project

This project was developed during the Google ML Bootcamp. It allows users to upload an image of a table, which is then processed by the model and rendered as an HTML table on a web interface.

## Model Details
For detailed information about the model, please refer to [this link](https://huggingface.co/qhfmshal/TRPaliGemma).

## Features
- Upload an image of a table, and the model will output the result in an HTML format.
  
## Future Enhancements
1. Display the table on the screen in an editable format.
2. Allow users to save the edited table as an image and download it.
3. Provide a list of previously edited tables or images for users to review.
